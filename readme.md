# Cider.js

Want to jump right in? [Here's the demo](http://paulstraw.com/cider).

Cider is some kind of HTML5 game engine, or whatever. It's currently under construction by [Paul Straw](http://paulstraw.com). He's hoping to have something useful done by the end of 2012. We'll see.

Pull requests are welcome (Though until all the basic architecture is in place, I'm not sure how much sense it makes for other people to do too much). If you're looking to contribute, I recommend using [CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit/) to mash all the `./src` stuff down to one file, and [Docco](http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/) for documentation generation (`docco src/*.coffee`).
